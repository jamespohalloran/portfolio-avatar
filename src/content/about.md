Hey! I'm James O'Halloran, a software developer from Prince Edward Island,
Canada. I created the video game "Miner Meltdown", and now spend
most of his time making tools to make web development extra awesome.
I have over ten years of experience working as a developer. Oh! and
me and my lovely wife run the sock company, awkosock.com!
